# StoryFlame Swing

StoryFlame Swing is a desktop application for managing writing projects and their chapters. It allows users to create projects, add chapters, and edit chapter content including titles, summaries, and the main text.

The application is built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and persists project data locally in a JSON file (`projects.json` located in `~/.storyflame/`).
